# geo-ninjas

> A Vue.js project

This is a project that enables real-time chat between users online by creating personal message boards for each user and pinpoints their physical location using the Google Maps API. Hosting and storage is provided by Firebase.

Deployed on https://udemy-geo-ninjas-e3b91.web.app/. Note that some features may no longer work due to the expiration of the API key and Firestore configurations.
